# hello-world
This is my first attempt at GitHub
I'm learning how to code because I'm interested in blockchain, digital assets and cryptocurrency.
It started as an interest in BTC and ETH in 2017 and mostly regarding trading but now I am trying to learn all about this so I can work in this new exciting space.
Programming and coding is more interesting and creative than I thought it would be.
